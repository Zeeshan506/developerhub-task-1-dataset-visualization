# Task 1 - Iris Dataset Visualization  
**DeveloperHub Corporation | AI/ML Engineering Internship**

## Objective  
Explore and visualize the famous **Iris dataset** to understand its structure, feature relationships, distributions, and potential outliers.

---

## Key Concepts  
- Data loading and inspection using **pandas**
- Summary statistics using `.info()` and `.describe()`
- Basic plotting and visualization with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**
  - Scatter plots
  - Histograms
  - Box plots

---

## Dataset  
The **Iris dataset** is a classical dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains:

- **150 rows (samples)**
- **4 numeric features**:
  - `sepal_length`
  - `sepal_width`
  - `petal_length`
  - `petal_width`
- **1 categorical label**:
  - `species` (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

Dataset is loaded using:
```python
import seaborn as sns
iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")

```

##***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)***
The following steps and plots were used to explore the dataset:
- Data inspection using .info() and .describe()
- Histograms (histplot) to understand value distributions
- Box plots to detect outliers in each numeric feature
- Scatter plots to observe relationships between features, especially petal_length vs petal_width across species
- All visualizations were implemented using ***Matplotlib*** and ***Seaborn***, and arranged with ***plt.subplots()*** for clarity.

---

##***Note***
No machine learning models were applied in this task. The focus was purely on data visualization and understanding the dataset through EDA.
